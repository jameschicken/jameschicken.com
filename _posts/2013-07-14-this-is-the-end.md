This Is the End: A-

About a month ago, I saw the movie, "This Is the End". Considering a bunch of comedic stars are in this movie, and are all playing themselves, I expected this movie to be awesome and really funny. This movie actually exceeded my expectations. According to imdb.com, this movie is about: "Attending a party at James Franco's house, Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel and many other celebrities are faced with the apocalypse". Everyone in this movie stars as themselves, so I will just list the actor's names. Also, since there is so many actors in this movie, I will only name the few that were the main characters and the few that stood out in my mind as the most memorable in this film. Seth Rogan did a very good job in this movie. As always, he was hilarious. I do not think that this movie would have been this good, if it was not for his acting. Jay Baruchel was also in this movie. I think he was really funny and clever in some of the ways he expressed his lines. Another actor in this movie was James Franco. He was also very funny and goofy as always with that bright smile on his face. Jonah Hill in this movie was pretty funny. I do think, however that he played a character that was too sensitive. In my mind, he did not act the way he usually acts in most of the movies he stars in. Danny McBride also stars in this movie. Personally, I thought he acted too arrogant in this movie. I think it was mostly because of the writing for his character. However, he did have quite of a few funny lines though. Craig Robinson also stars in this film. As always, I thought his acting was hilarious! I remember laughing through almost all of his lines and acting parts. Emma Watson was also in this movie. For the few parts she was in, I thought she did a really good job, considering she is not much of a comedic actress. The one memorable actor I will mention is Michael Cera. I thought he was absolutely hilarious, although he was not in the movie much. The character he plays in this movie was the exact opposite of the way he acts in all of his other movies. Instead of acting shy, calm and polite, he acted bold, crazy and rude.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was definitely one of the funniest movies I have ever seen! I do not necessarily recommend to see this movie in theaters, but I do recommend this movie to anyone who has a sense of humor and do not mind inappropriateness.
