We're the Millers: A-

About a month ago, I saw the movie, "We're the Millers". I was expecting this movie to be funny, but not this funny! Jason Sudeikis plays David Clark, a veteran pot dealer who creates a fake family as part of his plan to move a huge shipment of weed into the U.S. from Mexico. As always, in my opinion, I thought he was hilarious in this movie and had a lot of funny lines to go with. Jennifer Aniston plays Rose O'Reilly, a local stripper who agrees to pose as David's fake wife. I am actually not that big of a Jennifer Aniston fan, but over the past 3 years, I found she had funnier roles, so I became more fond of her. I think she also was pretty funny and had a lot of good lines in this movie. She also provided some nice eye candy. Emma Roberts plays Casey Mathis, a hobo-like, living on the streets runaway who agrees to pose as David's fake daughter. I have been a fan of Emma Roberts since her role in Scream 4 and in this movie, she also did a very good job and was very funny. Will Poulter plays Kenny Rossmore, a virgin who is David's next door neighbor in his apartment. He agrees to pose as David's fake son. I have never seen this actor in a movie before, but in this movie, his character was very funny and entertaining to watch. Ed Helms plays Brad Gurdlinger, David's boss who sends David on this quest to get the pot from Mexico and bring back the pot to Brad back across the border to America. Ever since the Hangover trilogy, I have been a fan of his comedic talent, and this movie is no exception. From start to finish, his character was hilarious! Nick Offerman plays Don Fitzgerald, father of the family that the "Millers" meet along their travels. If anyone watches the comedic television show, "Parks and Recreation", you know this actor will not disappoint; nor did he disappoint in this movie either. Kathryn Hahn plays Elie Fitzgerald, mother of the family that the "Millers" meet along their journey. This actress, if you have not seen her before has just about been in every comedy movie in the last decade. Her roles in these movies, even this one (although minor) make these movies even funnier!

Overall, this movie was hilarious from beginning to end, and I would recommend it to anyone who has a sense of humor. Also, I recommend you see this in theaters. If not, you should rent or even buy it when it comes to DVD and Blu-Ray.
