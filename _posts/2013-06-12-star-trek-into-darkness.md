Star Trek Into Darkness: A-

A month or so ago, I saw the movie, "Star Trek Into Darkness". I thought this movie would be pretty good, but it blew me away. This is the sequel to the start of a new Star Trek movie franchise. This movie is about the crew of the Enterprise and their quest to find an unstoppable force of terror within their own organization. Captain Kirk leads the Enterprise to a war-zone world to capture this man, who is capable of mass destruction. Chris Pine returns as Captain Kirk. I think, as he did in the previous Star Trek film, he did a great job. I never really liked Chris Pine, or never knew what kind of actor he really was, until I saw him in these two Star Trek movies that have been released. Zachary Quinto also returns as Spock. I feel like he did a really good job, considering that he was a bigger part to the movie than the previous first one. Zoe Saldana returns, as well, as Uhura. I thought she also played a bigger part in this movie, compared to the previous one. I also think that she did a better job in this sequel compared to the first movie. Benedict Cumberbatch was one of the two newest members to the cast, playing the role of the villain, Khan. I never knew who Cumberbatch was until I saw this movie, but given what I saw from this film, he did the best job in his role as anyone else in my opinion. His character was very believable, so much in fact that I almost started to believe this is the way he is in real life! Simon Pegg returns as Scotty. I personally loved Simon Pegg's performance in the first movie, but in this sequel, they did not include him as much as they did in the first film. This is the only thing that really disappointed me about this movie. The second and last newcomer to this new franchise is Alice Eve, who plays Dr. Carol Marcus. I think she did a pretty good job, considering the few key scenes that she was in. Also, for the male viewers out there, she provided some nice eye candy.

Overall, I think this was easily one of the best movies of the summer, considering all the action, adventure, and even some comedy that this movie contained. I would definitely recommend this movie to be seen in theaters first. If you like action movies, and plenty of explosions and violence, I would 100% recommend this movie to you.
