GI Joe: Retaliation: C+

A month ago, I went to see the movie, "GI Joe: Retaliation". I expected it to be moderately good and that is what I got from it. This movie is about the G.I. Joes who not only fight their mortal enemy Cobra; they are forced to contend with threats from within the government that jeopardize their very existence. The acting in this movie was decent, however slightly corny. Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is one of the newcomers to the GI Joe movies. He plays Roadblock whose primary function in G.I. Joe is as a heavy machine gunner. He does a great job, as he does in any other role he portrays. Another newcomer is Adrianne Palicki who plays as the character Lady Jane. Personally, I do not remember seeing her in a movie, considering she focuses primarily as a model. However, I think she did a pretty good job considering. Channing Tatum returns as Duke in this sequel, however he is only in the first half hour of the movie. I was not offended at all by this considering in GI Joe: Rise of the Cobra, his acting (in my opinion) was just terrible. The villain, Destro was not in this one. However, the villain Cobra Commander returns, but played by Luke Bracey instead of Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the previous installment. He did a good job acting though. Byung-hun Lee returns as Storm Shadow. His stunts in this movie were pretty good, as well as his acting. Jonathan Pryce returns as the President of The United States. He did a decent job. Arnold Vosloo returns as Zartan, however for a very short period of time. There is also a cameo by Bruce Willis, who plays General Joe Colton. His acting was great, even providing some comedic relief.

Overall, I consider this movie pretty good, however not great. If you want to see this movie, I suggest renting it. It is really not worth seeing it in theaters or buying it. The plot was pretty unrealistic at some parts. I would say this movie is mediocre at best.
