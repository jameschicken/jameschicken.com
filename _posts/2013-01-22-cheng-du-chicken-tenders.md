This chicken had a great taste to it, though partially bland. It is very easy to chew and it goes down pretty good. However if you do not like Chinese food, I do not recommend this chicken. I had ketchup as a dipping sauce and a coke as my beverage. I highly recommend the ketchup because it adds more flavor to the tenders. The napkins here are very neat and organized. Also, their menus are very fancy with some nice fabric material around them. These menus added to the environment of the restaurant.

Overall, I'd say if you like Chinese food, I highly recommend the chicken tenders Cheng-Du has.

I'll give these a rating of 9 out of 10 clucks.
