Thor: The Dark World: A-

Last week, I saw the movie, "Thor: The Dark World". I was expecting this to be awesome and have mind-blowing action, and it certainly met my expectations. According to imdb.com, this movie is about: "Faced with an enemy that even Odin and Asgard cannot withstand, Thor must embark on his most perilous and personal journey yet, one that will reunite him with Jane Foster and force him to sacrifice everything to save us all." Chris Hemsworth returns in the title role as Thor, the God of Thunder. As in the original Thor movie, he did a really good acting job. I think that overall, in my opinion, the role of Thor went to the best possible actor out there since this role seems to fit Hemsworth so well. Natalie Portman returns as Jane Foster, the scientist who originally discovered Thor in "Thor". I think she did a really good job in her role, as she did in the 1st one. Tom Hiddleston also returns as Loki. Hiddleston's performance as Loki throughout the 1st one, "The Avengers", and this one were absolutely spot-on! I think that without Loki, this movie series would not be even close to as good if they did not go to Tom Hiddleston to play Loki. I am so glad they stayed with him. Anthony Hopkins also returns as Odin The All-Father, father of Thor and adoptive father of Loki. Hopkins never ceases to amaze me. Even at age 75, he still seems to have the ability to act and act very well I might add, especially in this movie. Christopher Eccleston is the new edition to this franchise playing the role of the main villain, Malekith the leader of the evil dark elves who want to plunge the world int0 darkness, where they thrive. I first saw Eccleston in the movie, "G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra" , where he played the role of James McCullen/Destro, and he did a great job playing the villain in that movie which he also did in this movie. Kat Dennings and Stellan Skarsg√•rd also return as Darcy Lewis and Erik Selvig, respectively. As in the first "Thor" movie, they both provided hilarious comedic relief.

Overall, I thought this movie was great, and I highly recommend it to anyone who has seen the first "Thor" movie and/or enjoys a good action movie. I recommend seeing it in theaters though, if you get the chance.
