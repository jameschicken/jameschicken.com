Handicap Accessibility Rating: B+

Location: [157 Turnpike Road  Westborough, MA 01581](https://www.google.com/maps/place/157+Turnpike+Rd,+Westborough,+MA+01581/@42.2852669,-71.6126995,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89e40a85db5a8573:0x343827cfd7d8a5db)

Description:

There are reserved handicap parking spaces located closest to the sidewalk with a ramp for wheelchair access. Once you are on the sidewalk outside the restaurant it will lead to a set of stairs, and a concrete ramp. The ramp does have a sharp turn but has a landing to allow for turning by the wheelchair and an assistant behind it if needed.  The lobby is spacious enough to allow other people to get by without constantly having to move while your waiting to be seated. They have renovated recently and although it was redesigned with individual table privacy in mind there are still large tables here and there that allow you to sneak the wheelchair in without people bumping into it all night.

*The reason for the B+:*

It came down to their recent renovations, what used to be a much more open floor plan is now sectioned off into rooms and some places even between tables. This is great for everyone looking to eat in public and have some sound barrier between them and another table. However, when it comes to handicap accessibility it does create a bottleneck.
