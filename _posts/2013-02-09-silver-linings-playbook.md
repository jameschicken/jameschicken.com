Silver Linings Playbook: A+

A week ago, I went to see Silver Linings Playbook and wow; was I surprised. I knew it was going to be a good movie, being nominated for the Oscars and all, but I was not expecting this. Parts of it were funny and parts of it were sad. First of all Jennifer Lawrence should do movies like this more often. Her performance as Tiffany was moving and amazing. This all-star cast included: Bradley Cooper, Robert De Niro, Chris Tucker and Julia Stiles. Bradley Cooper's performance as Pat was very emotional, playing a character with Bipolar Disorder. He always looked to the "silver lining" for guidance when presented with tough situations. I think people with Bipolar Disorder can really empathize with that. Robert De Niro's performance as Pat Sr. was also brilliant. He played an emotional, dramatic character who always wanted the best for his son, Pat. Finally, Chris Tucker's performance as Danny, I assume, was for comic relief. I'm assuming this due to the fact that every scene he was in made me laugh a lot.

Overall, this movie was a lot less sad than I thought and much more funnier than I thought. I would easily recommend this movie to anyone.

It was easily the best movie I've seen in years!
