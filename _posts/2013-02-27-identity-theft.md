Identity Thief: B+

A week ago I saw the movie, Identity Thief. Going into this movie, I assumed that it would just be a mediocre slapstick type of comedy movie. However, it turned out to be a genuinely all around funny movie. First of all, Jason Bateman never fails to impress and in this movie it really showed. His role of his character Sandy Patterson was very funny and clever. Melissa McCarthy never disappoints and in this movie, she does just that. The movie is about Sandy Patterson, a business man who has a job as an accounts processor, who gets his identity stolen by a woman, Diana (played by Melissa McCarthy). She uses his identity to buy anything she wanted which made Sandy lose a lot of money. He is about to lose his job when Sandy comes up with a plan to turn Diana in by going to get her, in exchange for his job back. Things change however when Sandy finds out that Diana is a lot tougher than she looks when he has trouble catching her. However, he does end up catching her which results in a road trip that turns out to be a road trip from hell for Sandy.

Overall, this movie was really funny (being laughable all the way to the very end). Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthy make a great team of comedians, especially in this movie. With a star-studded cast ranging from Jason Bateman, Melissa McCarthy, Jon Favreau, Amanda Peet, John Cho and Eric Stonestreet how can you go wrong. Anyone who likes comedies should see this movie.
