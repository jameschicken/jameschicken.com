Olympus Has Fallen: A+

A couple of weeks ago I saw the movie, "Olympus Has Fallen". I expected this movie to be good but WOW was this movie awesome! From beginning to end, this movie kept me at the edge of my seat. This movie is about a failed  former Presidential guard Mike Banning, played by Gerard Butler, who finds himself trapped in the White House after he gets called in by his boss, Secret Service Director Lynn Jacobs, played by Angela Bassett following a terrorist takeover at the White House. Banning, using his knowledge with the help of national security, try to rescue the President, played by Aaron Eckhart, from his kidnappers. Gerard Butler belongs in these types of movies with action and he sure shows it in this movie. His performance as Mike Banning was very masterful. Not to mention a few jokes to lighten the mood of the situation. Aaron Eckart's performance of the President of the United States was very resilient and dramatic. During being captured, the lines he had were very intense. Morgan Freeman played Secretary of State Speaker and eventual acting President Martin Trumbull. His performance was, as always in my opinion, brilliant and spot-on. He made his character very believable and great to watch. Melissa Leo played Secretary of Defense Ruth McMillan. Her performance, as in her performance in "The Fighter" was great. Her lines were also very intense and spot-on. Her character never gave in, even when hope seemed hopeless. Angela Bassett played Secret Service Director Lynn Jacobs. Her performance was very to the point and believable. Finally Rick Yune played the leader of the terrorist group from North Korea, Kang. His performance was very cynical and conniving. He was also very into his role, showing no expression on his face and showing no mercy.

Overall, I greatly enjoyed watching this movie. The action was very realistic and ongoing throughout the whole movie and it was very believable to me. I would recommend this movie to anyone, except children and people who do not enjoy lots of blood and gore.
