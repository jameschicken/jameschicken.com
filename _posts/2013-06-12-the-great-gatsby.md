The Great Gatsby: B+

A month ago, I saw the movie, "The Great Gatsby", which is based on the novel of the same name by F. Scott Fitzgerald. I was expecting this movie to be a pretty accurate representation of the book and that is what I got from the movie. For those of you who have not read the book, "The Great Gatsby" is about Midwesterner Nick Carraway, who serves as the narrator of the novel and the movie, and him being lured into the world of his next-door neighbor, Jay Gatsby. Through Gatsby, Nick learns lessons in obsession, madness, and tragedy. Nick is eventually drawn into the lifestyle and past of his rich neighbor. Tobey Maguire plays the role of Nick Carraway in the movie. I have not really been a big Tobey Maguire fan, but I think, given the major role he had to play in this movie, he did a pretty good job. Although, there were a couple of parts in the movie where it seemed to be a little awkward, but that might just be me. Leonardo DiCaprio played Jay Gatsby. I think the director, Baz Luhrmann, did the best job in the hiring of an actor to play the role of Jay Gatsby. I know this because Leonardo DiCaprio did an absolutely remarkable job playing Gatsby. To me, it is as if the role in the book was designed to go to DiCaprio for the movie. Carey Mulligan played Daisy Buchanan. I think she did a very accurate portrayal of Daisy. For those of you who have read the book, I think this movie was very accurate to the book, compared to the other Great Gatsby movies that are out there. It covered absolutely everything.

Overall, I would say that this movie was good, but not great. However, it was extremely accurate to the novel and a lot of actors did a great job in their portrayals of each character. I would highly recommend seeing this movie (It does not necessarily have to be seen in theaters), especially to anyone who read the book.
