The Hangover Part III: B-

Over a month ago, I saw the movie, "The Hangover Part III". I was expecting good things from this movie, and it clearly met my expectations. This movie was about the continuing adventures of Phil(Bradley Cooper), Stu(Ed Helms), and Alan(Zach Galifianakis) and their quest to find Mr. Chow(Ken Jeong) because Chow stole money from a drug lord, Marshall(John Goodman) and Marshall kidnaps Doug(Justin Bartha) until the wolfpack bring Chow to him. Bradley Cooper returns as Phil. I think Cooper did a better job acting in this one, compared to the 2nd "Hangover" film. Ed Helms also returns as Dr. Stuart Price. Helms, as he was in the past two "Hangover" movies, had quite a few funny scenes. Zach Galifianakis returns as Alan Garner too. Zach, as always in this series, was the funniest character in the movie. His personality never fails to make me laugh. Ken Jeong also returns in this film as Mr. Leslie Chow. Not like the other two films in this series, Chow has a much bigger, longer part in this final film in the "Hangover" trilogy. He had a lot of funny parts and I think Ken Jeong did a good job enacting those parts. The first of two newcomers to this movie trilogy is John Goodman, who plays the character of Marshall. I thought that John Goodman did the finest acting job that I have seen in any of his other roles in movies. He was not funny, but he was very into his character. The other newcomer to this movie trilogy is Melissa McCarthy, who plays the role of Cassie. I thought she was very funny in all of the scenes she was in, especially her scenes with Zach Galifianakis. Justin Bartha returns as Doug. Although he once again was not in a "Hangover" movie that much, I think he did a pretty good job.

Overall, I thought this movie was good and very funny in most parts. I also thought that this "Hangover" movie was better than the second film in this trilogy, but not as good as the first film in the trilogy. There is also a funny scene during the credits. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good laugh, especially those of you who saw these other two "Hangover" films. Since it is not playing in that many theaters anymore because it has been out for so long, I recommend watching this on demand, when available or on DVD or Blu-Ray when available.
