Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters 3D: C+

I went to the movies last night and saw Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters 3D. When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I thought it was going to be really awful; but, It ended up being a pretty descent movie. It starts off with the actual fairytale; where Hansel & Gretel stumble upon a house made out of candy and get captured by a witch, who tries to fatten Hansel up by force feeding him candy and eat them. They trick the witch and push her into the oven and let her burn to death. The rest of the movie takes place 15 years later, where Hansel & Gretel have become witch hunters. There was quite a bit of action in this movie. I enjoyed the clever traps they set to kill some of the witches in the movie. Also, the spells they used were pretty cool too. The only problems I had with this movie were that it was a little too dark for me and it ended up being very predictable.

Overall, I enjoyed the movie, but I wish it was a little less darker, had more action scenes and had a little less blood.
