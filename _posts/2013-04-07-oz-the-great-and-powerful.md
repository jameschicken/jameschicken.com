Oz the Great and Powerful: C+

About a week ago I saw the movie, "Oz the Great and Powerful". I did not expect much from this movie and that is what I got. I understand why  people would find this movie enjoyable. I just personally did not enjoy it. I do not want to give too much away, but this movie is about an up and coming magician and illusionist Oscar "Ozd" Diggs, played by James Franco. This movie tells the story of Oz's eventual quest to become the Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz. James Franco's role of Oz was very predictable and not that enjoyable. His lines were very cheesy and sarcastic, which I personally did not like. Mila Kunis played the witch Theodora. Her performance was pretty good and was pretty enjoyable to watch. What happens to her character at the end was very surprising and unexpected, which made her role more entertaining to watch. Rachel Weisz played the evil wicked witch Evanora. Her performance was very cynical and evil, and in my opinion, she did a good job. She was very believable and her lines were full of wickedness and deceit. Michelle Williams played the good witch Glinda. Her character had to have a very sweet and sunny disposition. In that regard, her performance was very well done. Finally, Tony Cox played Knuck, the herald and fanfare player of Emerald City who is allies with Glinda. His character was basically, I believe, put there for comedic relief. His performance was very funny and entertaining to watch.

Overall, I did not really enjoy this movie as much as other people did. It did however have its moments, but overall it was not that enjoyable to me. I would recommend this movie to anyone who was a fan of the original Wizard of Oz movie in 1939. For everyone else, I would not waste your time and money going to see this movie in theaters.
