Location: [771 Southbridge Street, Auburn, MA 01501](https://www.google.com/maps/place/771+Southbridge+St,+Auburn,+MA+01501/@42.1820072,-71.8654979,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89e41cacd32ec5b7:0xc055f43d50c08413!6m1!1e1)

Description:

The parking spaces are closest to the front door which is always great if you want to go out in harsher weather. What makes this restaurant a little easier to get into is the restaurant is at the same level as the parking lot so there is no ramp, no stairs,  just one level. This makes getting into the restaurant extremely easy. One downside is the lobby has little space for someone in a wheelchair or an attendant behind them to stay out of the way of other patrons. This is not a large restaurant, the bar is sectioned off from the regular booths and tables but the rest of the restaurant floor plan is open. However, they do cram a lot of tables into a small floor plan and this creates a problem for those in a wheelchair. We went with a large party, but the table had little space between us and another table. This created a constant disruption as people were frequently bumping into the chair.

*The reason for the B:*

The tight seating arrangements make it hard to wait for a table, or sit without being constantly bumped into.
