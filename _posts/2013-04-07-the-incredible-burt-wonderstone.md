The Incredible Burt Wonderstone: B-

Last month, I went to see the movie, "The Incredible Burt Wonderstone". Originally, I did not expect much from this movie even though I am a huge Steve Carell and Jim Carrey fan. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how funny and entertaining this movie really was. Steve Carell as the magician, Burt Wonderstone was very funny to watch. His lines were both inappropriate and hilarious at the same time. Burt had an assistant, Anton Marvelton played by Steve Buscemi. I did not really enjoy Buscemi's performance as much as Carell's performance. However, I personally do not really like Steve Buscemi doing these types of movies. I like him better in Dramas such as the movie, "Reservoir Dogs" or the TV series, "Boardwalk Empire". However I did have a chuckle or two during some of his lines. Jim Carrey played rival street magician Steve Gray. His performance was a little unorthodox, I admit, but it was extremely hysterical and that is what you expect from Jim Carrey. The last character I should mention is Wonderstone's and Marvelton's replacement helper, Jane, played by Olivia Wilde. Her performance was about equal to that of the performances by Steve Carell and Jim Carrey. She was pretty entertaining and for the men, she was nice eye candy!

Overall this movie was about all you can expect from a comedy movie. It was funny, entertaining, and the magic tricks that were shown were pretty spectacular to watch. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good comedy and enjoys watching magicians do magic.
