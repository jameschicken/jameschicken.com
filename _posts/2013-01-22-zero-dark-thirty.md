Zero Dark Thirty:  B-

I went to the movies last weekend and saw the 6:50 showing of  Zero Dark Thirty, it seemed a little lengthy at 2:37 minutes. In the trailer it looked action packed and I was in the mode to go see an action packed military flick. However, I was wrong on about 2 hours of the movie's content. It focuses on the CIA agent who was working in Pakistan and the surrounding region. Mainly showing her interrogating prisoners trying to track down Osama Bin Laden's location. It turns out the trailer's special ops invading the compound scene is one of the final parts of the movie (no surprise) but there was little action besides that. The rest of it was the CIA agents point of view during the search. In my opinion the "hunt" in this movie could have been condensed into about an hour or so, and then let the half hour of the Navy Seals black op wrap it up.

Overall I enjoyed the movie,  I just think it was a little too long.
