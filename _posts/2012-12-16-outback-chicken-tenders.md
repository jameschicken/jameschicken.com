The chicken tenders at Outback Steakhouse are amazing! I had them with a regular coke. They are a little dry though, but they taste great! They are also easy to chew on and go down easily. The seasoning they put on them makes the chicken very flavorful, which makes them even better than other restaurants. The dipping sauce I suggest and used is just ketchup. Very good chicken! I highly recommend it! I had fries as a side. Their french fries are also pretty good. However, I liked their chicken tenders better. They were a little mushy, but still pretty good considering that their fries have the same type of seasoning as their chicken tenders. However, as far as fries go, they were not really good enough for me; although still descent. I'd say that that the mashed potatoes are made from the same potatoes as my fries. I think having specific spuds for each purpose could hinder the taste of each.

I'll give this chicken a score of 10 out of 10 clucks.
