Fast & Furious 6: A-

About a month ago, I saw the movie, "Fast & Furious 6". As the other Fast & Furious movies, this sixth one in this franchise, I was expecting it to be really good with lots of action and it did not disappoint. Everyone from every "Fast & Furious" movie made so far, was included in this one. This one is about the reassembling of the "Fast & Furious" crew to take down a mastermind criminal of an organization of mercenary drivers across 12 countries, in return for full pardons for the whole crew. Vin Diesel returns as Dominic Toretto. In this movie, as in the other "Fast & Furious" movies he has been in, he did a great job acting. Paul Walker returns as Brian O'Connor. In this movie, and the other movies in this series that he was in, I did not think his acting was up to par. Maybe I just do not like Paul Walker, but I digress. Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson returns for his second time in this movie series as C.I.A. agent Luke Hobbs. As in "Fast Five", I think he did a really good job acting and fighting. Jordana Brewster also returns as Mia, Dom's sister and Brian's wife. I think, compared to her roles in the other films in this franchise, she did not act as well. Although, she was not in much of the movie. Being absent in the last movie, but later revealed to be alive, Michelle Rodriguez returns as Letty. I personally thought she did a great job in this film, considering the type of role she takes in the movie. One of the two new characters to this franchise, Luke Evans plays the villain, Owen Shaw. I do not know Luke Evans too well, but I thought he portrayed a great villain. The last of the new characters to this franchise, Gina Carano plays the second in command to Shaw, Riley. I have only seen Carano in a few movies, but I think she did a great job acting and fighting.

Overall, compared to the other five "Fast & Furious" movies, was the best out of all of them. As well as having a lot of action, this movie in this franchise also had a lot more attitude and fighting in it. I would recommend this movie firstly be seen in theaters if possible and secondly, be seen by any fans of action movies or the other "Fast & Furious" movies in this franchise. There is also a surprising cameo appearance seen during the credits, which makes this movie even better.
