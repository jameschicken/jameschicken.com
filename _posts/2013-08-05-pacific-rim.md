Pacific Rim: A+

A month ago, I saw the movie, "Pacific Rim". I was expecting this movie to be good, but not this good! It blew me away! According to imdb.com, this movie is about: "As a war between humankind and monstrous sea creatures wages on, a former pilot and a trainee are paired up to drive a seemingly obsolete special weapon in a desperate effort to save the world from the apocalypse." Charlie Hunnam plays Raleigh Becket, a washed-up Jaeger pilot called out of retirement to help fight off the monsters(Kaijus). I do not know who Charlie Hunnam is, (people tell me he is on the show, "Sons of Anarchy") but he did a great job acting in this movie. Idris Elba plays Stacker Pentecost, Raleigh's commanding officer and sort of the leader of all the robot(Jaeger) pilots. As he does with all of his roles, Idris Elba did a great job in this movie. I think that he did the best acting job in this movie out of everyone else. It also seemed like he was made for this role. Rinko Kikuchi plays Mako Mori, Raleigh's co-pilot in the Jaeger, Gipsy Danger, who lost her family in a Kaiju attack. I have never seen Rinko Kikuchi in a movie before, but she did a pretty good job acting in this movie. Charlie Day plays Dr. Newton Geiszler, one of two scientists who study the Kaijus. I think, as always in all of his roles, he did a very good job and was really funny. I also think that his character mostly serves as comedic relief, as well as to help the audience understand what the Kaijus are and where they came from.   Burn Gorman plays Dr. Hermann Gottlieb, Dr. Newton Geiszler's assistant scientist that helps Geiszler in the studying of the Kaijus. I have also never seen Burn Gorman in a movie before, but I think he did a pretty good job. Ron Perlman plays Hannibal Chau, a black market dealer who sells parts of dead Kaijus to the highest bidder. As in most of his movies, I think Perlman did a really good job in his role. He also provides some comedic relief throughout the movie.

Overall, I would say "Pacific Rim" was a really amazing and awesome movie! From start to finish, this movie has nonstop action and plenty of entertainment. If you can see this in theaters, I would highly recommend it. If not, I would definitely get it on DVD or Blu-Ray when it comes out. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good action movie. However, I would not recommend this movie to anyone who hates violence.
