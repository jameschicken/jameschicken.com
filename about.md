My name is James Rossetti and I have Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. I am currently 23 years old. I'm a laid back person, who is easy to talk to. I go to college at Quinsigamond Community College. I'm pretty shy of people sometimes, but if you just give me a chance, I will definitely be more open to share conversations. I created this website to show people the best places to go that have the best chicken tenders ever.
